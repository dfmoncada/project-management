Mission Statement: 

At <WE DESIGN/>, we take our client’s needs, desires,
concerns and aspirations with wholehearted commitment. Our brand
represents a standard of perfection and easy usability for all types of
internet users. This applies to all facets of your website in order to
create a stable, strong and beautiful website.

Strategy: 

It is our profession to create a website that provides internet
users with good experiences for both patients and staff members. We know
that having a responsive, reliable and accessible website translates
into better health care. At <WE DESIGN/>, objectives are met with
strategies. The strategy process begins with visualizing how the final
product should function and look. The process is sparked with asking
insightful questions such as: “What are the needs of the patients at
nshn.care?” and “What are the needs of staff members at nshn.care?”.
These questions lead the way to defining which features would benefit
NSHN. Once features are defined, the next step in our strategy is to
begin the realization process: The realization process contains four
stages. 
=======Step One: Incubation of ideas, sketch themes, flow charts and
chose organization methods. 
=======Step Two: Fertilize ideas by creating
mock-ups of every page that will appear. 
=======Step Three: Realize steps one
and two into functional code that is accessible (complies with AODA)
=======Step Four: Testing, trouble-shooting, training and launch.

Objectives:

Health care is at its best when all abled and
differently-abled persons can access the information they need when they
need it. That is why we make it an objective at <WE DESIGN/> to create a
responsive website. Having access to service information on-the-go, on a
website that is designed for the screen size of mobile devices, always
creates a wonderful user experience. It is just as imperative to create
a responsive website that is accessible for those with disabilities. For
example, screen readers requires that code is properly created and
built. Another objective of ours is intuitive site architecture to
eliminate content redundancy which minimizes the amount of clicks the
user must do. It is ideal for someone who is interested to volunteer to
find pertaining information conveniently as to not deter them. A goal
for your website would be to build community to enhance social
resources. A friendly, easy-to-use website can bring online traffic and
build a network beyond geographic limitations. Having an easy to use
Content Management System (CMS) is another objective of ours because it
enables staff members to have a good user experience. Creating web
applications can streamline many administrative duties so staff can
focus more on patients. Delegating certain aspects of running the
hospital to web applications, such as booking appointments, can greatly
optimize human resources. The possibilities are astounding and very
positive.

Conclusion:

With the implementation of our methods, we can recreate
nshn.care into a website that will grow the community and the
communities’ contribution exponentially. It is well worth the time,
effort and capital to invest in having a serious internet presence that
will ameliorate the experience of patients and staff members alike. We
hope you will decide to entrust this recreation with us at <WE_DESIGN>.
Thank you.
